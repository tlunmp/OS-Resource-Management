Project 5

project exec user process then let the child check if it will terminate, request, release resources, then it will return message queue what the master will do. with interval launch 500ms, and when something from message queue execute it will run in 0 to 250s. If user process release, it will release the allocated to the available, terminate it release the allocated to available. If it is requesting it will check if the available is greater than the request if not then goes to block else it will request.

for deadlock detection it will check the block queue and there loop that check if it can still get resources if not the kill process and release it if it can get it. it will request a resources. then after deadlock detection it will redo all remaining user process until all become terminated
